    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
        industry's<br>
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
        make<br>
        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
        typesetting,<br>
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
        containing<br>
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
        versions<br>
        of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
